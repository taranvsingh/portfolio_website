                            <p>
                                For the <span>PAREA CONSULTING</span> landing website project, I concentrated on delivering a refined user experience (UX) and interface (UI)</span> that would engage visitors while aligning seamlessly with the brandâ€™s professional image. Starting in <span>Figma</span>, I designed a <span>prototype</span> that prioritized intuitive navigation and clean, visually appealing layouts, guiding users to key content areas effortlessly. Each design element was carefully chosen for clarity and engagement, and I created unique, high-quality artwork for all images on the site to give it a cohesive, polished look that reinforced the brand's identity.
                            <br><br>
                                To further enhance UX, I incorporated <span>Google Tag Manager (GTM)</span> and <span>Google Analytics</span>, allowing for precise tracking of user behaviors and interactions without intrusive modifications to the code. These analytics tools provided insight into how users interacted with the site, from browsing patterns to contact form submissions. I also added Blogger integration, which allowed Parea Consulting to share insights and updates directly, keeping content fresh and relevant. By focusing on both the aesthetic and functional aspects of the website, I built a platform that not only looks professional but also provides a smooth, engaging user experience for visitors.

                                In the <span>TRIBBUTE</span> project, I developed a comprehensive resources page using <span>Webflow</span> to centralize valuable content, such as videos, articles, and newsletters. This page served as a hub for all informational materials, providing users with easy access to various resources. I implemented <span>JavaScript</span> to handle the functionality of displaying multiple types of content on a single page, enabling users to filter or view specific resources seamlessly. This improved the user experience by allowing flexible access to relevant information without navigating away from the main resources page.
                            <br><br>
                                Beyond content organization, I automated newsletter updates using <span>Klaviyo</span> and managed content uploads for the resources page, ensuring fresh materials were regularly available to engage users. This included managing articles, creating and editing videos, and integrating dynamic content updates through the <span>CMS</span>. Additionally, I created LinkedIn ads and handled media assets, utilizing <span>Canva</span> and <span>Procreate</span> for video editing and animation creation to enhance the brand's visual identity. These efforts collectively strengthened Tribbute's online presence, offering users a richer, more accessible platform to interact with valuable resources and stay connected with the brand.

                                The <span>Focus Friend</span> project was a prototype developed as part of my <span>Human-Computer Interaction (HCI)</span> course, where I applied <span>UI/UX</span> design principles to create an engaging time management web application. Utilizing <span>HTML</span>, <span>CSS</span>, and <span>JavaScript</span>, I worked collaboratively with a team to implement the <span>Pomodoro Technique</span>, which encourages users to break their work into focused intervals followed by short breaks. Our design emphasized user interaction and satisfaction, resulting in an intuitive interface that effectively aids users in managing tasks and maintaining productivity. The project was completed a week before the deadline, allowing time for refinement and testing, which contributed to achieving a remarkable score of <span>95%</span>, earning us bonus marks for our effort and early delivery.

                                For our Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) course, I worked with three peers to develop a music streaming app prototype that creatively blends retro aesthetics with modern interface functionality. Using a combination of <span>HTML</span>, <span>CSS</span> with the <span>Tailwind</span> library, <span>JavaScript</span>, and <span>jQuery</span>, we built a visually captivating interface that evokes nostalgia through retro elements while maintaining ease of use. <span>Tailwind CSS</span> allowed us to implement consistent styling efficiently, while <span>jQuery</span> and <span>JavaScript</span> enhanced the interactivity of elements, such as vintage-style sliders and clickable buttons, creating an immersive experience. <span>GitHub</span> was essential for version control throughout the project, ensuring that team members could work on different features simultaneously and maintain a coherent codebase.

                                To refine the design, we conducted usability testing and iterated on feedback, incorporating the principles of HCI to ensure an accessible and intuitive user journey. We focused on responsive design, making sure the app displayed seamlessly across devices, from desktops to mobile. This dedication to both functionality and style helped our team achieve a 90% score on the project, a testament to our success in balancing innovation with user-centered design. This project not only showcased our technical abilities but also demonstrated our commitment to delivering an engaging, efficient user experience.

                                As a Data Scientist in Agricultural Research at the University of Manitoba, I specialized in analyzing large datasets collected from <span>Vis-NIR</span> and <span>SWIR</span> imaging systems to improve crop management practices. My role involved employing advanced statistical methods, such as <span>Principal Component Analysis (PCA)</span> and <span>Partial Least Squares (PLS)</span>, to develop classification models for various grains and pulses. I collaborated closely with agronomists and engineers, conducting field studies and preparing research proposals to support innovative projects in agriculture. My work also included presenting findings at conferences and utilizing data visualization tools to effectively communicate insights to diverse audiences.

                                During my tenure, I successfully published a research paper on assessing mechanical damage and germinability in <span>flaxseeds</span> using <span>hyperspectral imaging</span>, contributing valuable knowledge to the field. I integrated <span>machine learning techniques</span> to enhance predictive modeling of crop yield and quality, ultimately aiding data-driven decision-making for local farmers. My experience has equipped me with strong analytical skills and proficiency in programming languages like <span>R</span> and <span>Python</span>, as well as data visualization tools like <span>Tableau</span> and <span>Matplotlib</span>, all of which have been essential in driving agricultural innovations.
